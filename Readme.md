# Attendance System Using Face Recognition
# Overview
This project implements a modern attendance system leveraging face recognition technology. The system automates the attendance tracking process by capturing and recognizing faces in real-time, providing a more secure and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

# Features
**Face Recognition:** Utilizes state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to identify individuals accurately.  
**Real-time Processing**: Captures and processes faces in real-time for immediate attendance tracking.  
**User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for easy system interaction and administration.  
**Database Integration:** Stores attendance records in a csv file for convenient retrieval and analysis.  

# Requirements
face_recognition library  
Python 3.6+  
OpenCV(pip install opencv-python)  
dlib   
Tkinter(Available in python)  
PIL (pip install Pillow)  
Pandas(pip install pandas)  
Numpy(pip install numpy)  

Editor - Visual studio code

 --Notes--
It will require high processing power(I have 8 GB RAM & 1 GB Nvidia GT740M Graphic Card)  
Noisy image can reduce your accuracy so quality of images matter.
